[introduction]
= Introduction

There are 2 ways to test your REST API using cucumber.
1. Use RestAssured to invoke your Rest API and assert on response
2. Use Spring mvc-test to test your RestController

You can adopt any strategy from above mentioned two according to your requirement.
RestDoc is able to capture request and response details and can create snippets which can be used by ASCIIDoc to create a nicely formatted html based documentation.
